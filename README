jQuery.urlFor

This small jQ plugin tries to simulate - in MVC's world - well-know url_for function.

Idea is mostly based on perl MVC framework ( Catalyst MVC uri_for and Mojolicious url_for ), as far as i know there is something like that in Ruby and Symfony.

You can use this plugin with the following parameters:

$.urlFor( "url" ) which generates "url"
$.urlFor( "/list","of","the","parameters" ) which generates "/list/of/the/parameters"
$.urlFor( "/action/:param1/:param2", { param1: "foo", param2: "bar" }) or 
$.urlFor( "/action/:param1/:param2", [ "foo", "bar" ]) which generate "/action/foo/bar"

An example, how to use this plugin:

window.MYNAMESPACE: {
	URLS:{
		editContact: "/contant/:id"
	}
};

$.ajax({
	url: $.urlFor( MYNAMESPACE.URLS.editContact, { id: $( "#elem" ).data( "id" ) } ), 
	....
});

Ideas, issues, patches are welcome.

Fork and have fun. :)
